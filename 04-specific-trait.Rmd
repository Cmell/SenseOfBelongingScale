# Specific Trait Form

The items for any specific form of the scale will be tailored for the identity or context in question. We validated the scale for a university student identity. The instructions were:

> Think about **your entire college career.** When you think about **your time as a student at the University of XXX,** to what extent do you feel **a sense of belonging and fitting in? **
 
> Please answer the questions below to help us understand how you feel.

Note the reference to their *specific* identity and the unbounded *trait* timeframe.

The response scale was the same as for the global trait items in Section \@ref(global-trait).

```{r specific-trait-items}
tibble(
  `Item Number` = 1:16,
  Item = c(
    "In general, as a student at XXX, I feel a sense of belonging.",
    "As a student at XXX, I don't really feel accepted.",
    "Overall, I feel valued by other students at XXX", 
    "As a student at XXX, I feel disregarded.",
    "As a student at XXX, I feel like I fit in.",
    "I feel like I don’t really fit in with other students at XXX",
    "I feel connected with other students at XXX.",
    "I feel so distant from other students at XXX.",
    "Overall, as a student at XXX I feel accepted by others.",
    "As a student at XXX, I don’t really feel like I belong anywhere.",
    "As a student at XXX, I feel appreciated.",
    "As a student at XXX, I don’t really feel valued for who I am.",
    "I feel at home as a student at XXX.",
    "As a student at XXX, I feel like a piece of a jig-saw puzzle that doesn’t fit into the puzzle.",
    "In general, as a student at XXX, I feel welcome.",
    "I feel disconnected from students at XXX."
