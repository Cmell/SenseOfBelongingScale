# Specific State Form

This form of the scale requires a *specific* identity and a constrained timeframe for the *state* measurement. Both elements can be adapated as necessary.

> When you think about being a **student at the University of XXX at this moment,** to what extent do you feel a sense of belonging and fitting in?

> **Think back over the past two weeks** and answer the questions below based on your feelings about being a **student at XXX over just the past two weeks.**

Note the reference to their *specific* identity and the unbounded *trait* timeframe.

The response scale was the same as for the global trait items in Section \@ref(global-trait).

```{r specific-state-items}
tibble(
  `Item Number` = 1:16,
  Item = c(
    "In the past two weeks, as a student at XXX, I felt a sense of belonging.",
    "In the past two weeks, as a student at XXX, I didn't really feel accepted.",
    "In the past two weeks, I felt valued by other students at XXX", 
    "In the past two weeks, as a student at XXX, I felt disregarded.",

    "In the past two weeks, I felt disconnected from students at XXX."
