# Global-Trait Form {#global-trait}

This page contains the 16 items of the SBS in their global-trait form, as well as some descriptive information for them. The SBS-8 is comprised of the first 8 items listed in the Table \@ref(tab:global-trait-items). Because the scale was validated under a 1-factor model, we recommend administering the scale on a 5 or 7 point Likert-type scale and averaging item responses to derive a total score. In the validation studies, we used this scale for all forms:

- Strongly disagree
- Somewhat disagree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Somewhat agree
- Strongly agree

The scale items were preceded by the following instructions:

> When you think **about your life,** to what extent do you feel **a general sense of belonging and fitting in?**

> Please answer the questions below to help us understand how you feel.

Table \@ref(tab:global-trait-items) below contains all items in their global form.

In Qualtrics, the survey appeared as in Figure \@ref(fig:qualtrics-preview-global-trait). **Note** that each set of 8 items was presented in a random order.
